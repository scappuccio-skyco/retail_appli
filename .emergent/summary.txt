The AI engineer successfully built the Retail Coach 2.0 SaaS application, starting from scratch. The initial phase established core features including user authentication (JWT), FastAPI backend, MongoDB integration, and basic Manager/Seller dashboards. OpenAI (via  and Emergent LLM key) was integrated for AI-driven sales feedback, and  for data visualization. After delivering a functional MVP, the work progressed to incorporating an invitation system for managers to onboard sellers and a Diagnostic vendeur avancé feature for new sellers. This diagnostic flow, a multi-step questionnaire with AI profiling, proved to be complex, leading to persistent React  rendering errors despite numerous refactoring attempts, including design changes, error boundaries, and component type variations. The communication system backend models were also introduced. The trajectory concludes with a lingering redirection issue after diagnostic completion, where the form incorrectly reappears due to a timing-related state hydration problem post-reload.

<product_requirements>
The Retail Coach 2.0 application aims to enhance retail sales performance through self-evaluation, AI feedback, and interactive dashboards, supporting Manager and Seller roles.
**Core Entities:** User (id, name, email, password, role, manager_id), Sale (id, seller_id, store_name, date, total_amount, comments), Evaluation (id, sale_id, 5 skill ratings 1-5, comments, AI feedback, radar scores), FeedbackTemplate (id, prompt_text, use_case).
**Authentication:** Login, register, logout with JWT. Managers oversee their own sellers; sellers access personal sales and evaluations.
**Seller Features:** A quick evaluation form (5 steps, 1-5 rating, optional comment) post-sale. AI provides positive coaching feedback (3-5 sentences) and calculates radar scores. A dashboard displays a radar chart, evaluation history, and skill evolution.
**Manager Features:** Dashboard listing sellers (name, avg score, last feedback), clickable seller profiles (radar, history, AI feedback summaries). Weekly AI insights. PDF report export (pending).
**AI Logic:** Utilizes OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini via Emergent LLM key) for generating  and diagnostic summaries.
**UI/UX:** Modern, mobile-friendly interface with two dashboards, quick evaluation form, radar chart, sidebar navigation, and glass-morphism effects.
**Implemented New Features:**
1.  **Manager Invitation System:** Managers can invite sellers via email, generating a unique token for registration.
2.  **Diagnostic vendeur avancé (Advanced Seller Diagnostic):** A 15-question multi-step form presented to new sellers upon account creation. It captures responses, sends them for AI analysis to generate a personalized  (style, level, motivation), stores results in a new  table, and displays the summary to both seller and manager.
3.  **Manager-Seller Communication (Backend):** Introduction of  and  models and API endpoints for communication.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on resolving a persistent issue with the Diagnostic vendeur avancé flow. Although the backend successfully processes and saves the diagnostic results (verified via API tests), the frontend exhibits a bug: after a new seller completes the 15-question diagnostic and the page attempts to redirect or reload, the diagnostic form incorrectly reappears on the  route.

This problem has led to numerous attempts to fix frontend rendering stability, including:
1.  **Refactoring ** multiple times using various React patterns (transitions, single-page forms, class components).
2.  **Disabling ** in .
3.  **Implementing an ** to catch rendering errors.
4.  **Forcing a full page reload** () after diagnostic submission.

Despite these efforts, the issue where the form reappears persists. The current hypothesis is a timing problem: when  is triggered from , the browser reloads the same page. During the brief period before  can re-fetch the user's updated  status from the backend, the  state is momentarily , causing the application to incorrectly render the diagnostic form again.

The last action taken was to modify  to change the redirection strategy from  to a specific navigation , aiming for a cleaner transition to the dashboard root () while also passing a URL parameter to signal a diagnostic reload.
