# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "CONFLICT RESOLUTION FRONTEND TESTING COMPLETED WITH CRITICAL ISSUE: ✅ SUCCESSFUL WORKFLOW: Login as manager1@test.com → Navigate to Test Vendeur 2 → Click 'Voir tous les détails' → Access 'Gestion de Conflit' tab → Fill all 5 form fields with specified data → Submit form successfully → Form resets after submission → History updates with new entry. ✅ Tab system integration works perfectly. ✅ Form validation and submission work correctly. ✅ No React DOM errors detected. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: AI recommendations display is incomplete - only 'Analyse de la situation' section appears in the UI, missing 3 required sections: 'Approche de communication', 'Actions concrètes', and 'Points de vigilance'. Backend returns all 4 AI fields correctly, but frontend ConflictResolutionForm.js may have display logic issues preventing the other sections from rendering. This breaks the expected user experience as managers only see 1/4 of the AI recommendations."

    message: "RETAIL COACH 2.0 SELLER DETAIL VIEW IMPROVEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: ✅ ALL MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS VERIFIED AND WORKING: 1) Débriefs Tab: Shows only 3 debriefs by default with working 'Charger plus (4 autres)' button that expands to show all 7 debriefs and changes to 'Voir moins', then collapses back correctly. 2) KPI Tab: All 3 filter buttons working (7j, 30j, Tout) with proper yellow highlighting, 4 KPI cards displayed (CA Total, Ventes, Clients, Panier Moyen), 2 graphs showing 'Évolution du CA' and 'Évolution des ventes' with data updating based on filter selection. 3) Conflict Resolution: Form submission working, AI generates recommendations with formal address ('vous', 'votre'), ALL 4 AI sections now displaying correctly (Analyse, Approche communication, Actions concrètes, Points vigilance), no React errors, history updates automatically. ✅ CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: Previous issue with missing AI recommendation sections has been fixed - all 4 sections now display properly. ✅ Formal address usage confirmed throughout AI responses. ✅ No React 'insertBefore' errors detected. ✅ All tab navigation working smoothly. ✅ Screenshots captured showing all functionality working as expected. MINOR ISSUE: AI still uses some informal address ('tu') mixed with formal ('vous') - not critical but could be improved for consistency."
